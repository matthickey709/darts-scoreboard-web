# React Native Darts Scoreboard

A sequel to the Java version I developed in 2019, this is a web-based version of a darts scoreboard.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Building the Project

Of course, start with a fresh clone and

`npm install`

To run on a local development server:

`npm run start-web`

To run a local "production" server:

`npm run build-web`

For some reason, expo isn't working to test this on mobile apps, but that may come soon, we'll see.
